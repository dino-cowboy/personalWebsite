        <p>As the Tech Coordinator for Friends of MSF at UTD, I wanted to boost our presence on campus, so I 
          built a website to help with recruitment. The goal was to give potential members an easy way to learn 
          about what we stand for and how they could get involved. I created the site using Node.js, HTML, CSS, 
          and Bootstrap. The website was an overall success as everyone in the club used it during recruiting events 
          to share info and connect with students. Along the way, I learned a lot about web design, frameworks, 
          and working with a real client to bring their vision to life. You can view the site by clicking the button 
          below !</div>

        <p> The SolderFan Wiki was a fun project where I repurposed an old desk fan into a solder smoke absorber.
           I used it as an opportunity to learn CAD design with Shapr3D and created a custom model to house a carbon
            filter. The final product worked really well, it pulled in solder smoke effectively and gave new life to 
            something I wasnâ€™t using anymore. Along the way, I learned how to navigate a new design tool, understood
             what goes into making functional products, and saw how easy it can be to bring an idea to life with the
              help of companies that support custom manufacturing. The wiki and 3D model can be viewed using the button below !

        <p>PinIt is a website that my group and I made during my first hackathon at HackUTD 2024.
          Our project's goal was to implement Pinata file API into any application of our choosing. My group decided
          to pursuit a website that will allow anybody to search for volunteer opportunities as well as allow organizations to upload their
          own opportunities for people to apply to. We were only able to get the front end development of the home page finished by the end of the hackathon, but I wanted
          to take it as challenge to actually implement Pinata API into the backend of our website. Clicking the button below will take you to the final 
          result of my group's work and I will be putting in extra work to bring the site to life !

        <p> The Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program is a UTD offered opportunity that allows undergraduate students to
           join research groups in the various departments within the university. My research group was in the material sciences department
           and we studied the effects that changing the polarity of LEDS from Ga-polar to N-polar has on the carrier concentrations, emission spectrum,
           IV curve, and the band diagrams. The goal of our research was to see if there was any improvement in changing the polarity of an LED, then move
           onto the polarity of photo-detectors with hopes of eventually improving fibre optic cables transmission and receiving speeds. By the end of my 
           program, I created a research poster to present to faculty and staff at a symposium. Clicking the button below will take you to my research poster !
